# odin-recipes

In this project, I constructed the recipes collection by using HTML.
You can find 
-the "Index" frontpage with links to the other pages.
-And "Images" folder for the .jpg photos (free stock photos)
-Recipe folder with following recipes:
1.Lasagna
2.Pancakes
3.Lentil Soup
- Each recipe contains an image, description, paragraph, unordered list of ingredient and an ordered list of steps.
- I also added a link to the front page to each recipe.
